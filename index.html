        <p>Mitchell L. Doucette, PhD, MS, is a nationally recognized epidemiologist and research leader whose work sits at the intersection of Epidemiology, Health Econmics and Outcomes Researcer, and Business Strategy. With over a decade of experience spanning academia and industry, Dr. Doucette leverages real-world evidence and advanced causal inference methodologies to inform clinical, regulatory, and commercial decision-making.</p>

        <p>Dr. Doucette currently serves as the Senior Director of Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR) at Leafwell, a healthcare technology and research company. In this role, he leads multidisciplinary teams in the design and execution of large-scale, observational studies using electronic health record (EHR), claims, and patient-reported outcome (PRO) data. His work supports product development, safety monitoring, and payer engagement strategies, demonstrating how rigorous analytics can guide market positioning and value-based care models.</p>

        <p>Before joining industry, Dr. Doucette served as Director of Research Methods and Assistant Scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, where he developed award-winning methodologies to evaluate the impact of health interventions and public policy. His novel statistical estimator, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, has been cited by leading academics and policymakers, including in a U.S. Supreme Court decision.</p>

        <p>Dr. Doucette is a two-time recipient of “Best Paper of the Year” awards, has secured over $6.5 million in competitive research funding, and has authored more than 35 peer-reviewed publications. He is known for translating complex research into actionable insights, advising both C-suite executives and academic collaborators on evidence generation that drives strategic outcomes.</p>

        <p>His unique ability to span methodological rigor and real-world application makes him a sought-after partner in solving some of healthcare’s most pressing challenges, whether by quantifying treatment impact, improving access, or supporting value demonstration in an evolving evidence ecosystem.</p>
