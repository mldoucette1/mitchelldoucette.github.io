With over a decade of experience spanning academia and industry, Dr. Doucette leverages real-world evidence and advanced causal inference methodologies to inform clinical, regulatory, and commercial decision-making.</p>

        <p>Dr. Doucette currently serves as the Senior Director of Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR) at Leafwell, a healthcare technology and research company. In this role, he leads multidisciplinary teams in the design and execution of large-scale, observational studies using electronic health record (EHR), claims, and patient-reported data.
